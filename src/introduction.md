# Fyrox Game Engine Book

Practical reference and user guides for [Fyrox Game Engine](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox) and its 
editor [FyroxEd](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/tree/master/editor).

**Warning:** The book is in early development stage, you can help to improve it by making a contribution in its
[repository](https://github.com/fyrox-book/fyrox-book.github.io). Don't be shy, every tip is helpful!

## Engine Version

Fyrox Team is trying to keep the book up-to-date with the latest version from `master` branch. If something does not 
compile with the latest release from crates.io, then you need to 
[use the latest engine from GitHub repo](./fyrox/beginning/scripting.md#using-latest-engine-version).

## How to read the book

Almost every chapter in this book can be read in any order, but we recommend reading Chapter 1 and then going
through [Platformer Tutorial (2D)](fyrox/tutorials/platformer/part1.md) while learning more about specific areas that
interest you from the other chapters. 

There is also a [First-Person Shooter Tutorial (3D)](fyrox/tutorials/fps/intro.md), but it is based on framework which
considered obsolete, yet it is still very helpful. 

## API Documentation

The book is primarily focused on game development with Fyrox, not on its API. You can find API docs
[here](https://docs.rs/fyrox/latest/fyrox/).

## Required knowledge

We're expecting that you know basics of Rust programming language, its package manager Cargo. It is also necessary
to know the _basics_ of the game development, linear algebra, principles of software development and patterns, 
otherwise the book will probably be very hard for you. 

## Support the development

The future of the project fully depends on community support, every bit is important!
