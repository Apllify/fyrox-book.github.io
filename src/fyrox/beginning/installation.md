## Installation (Obsolete)

**WARNING: This section considered obsolete - Fyrox 0.25+ has project generator that handles installation for you.
This section is intended to be used only if you're using the engine as a framework!**

Since the engine is distributed as a library, it has to be added to `[dependecies]` section of `Cargo.toml` of
your project to start using it, there is no pre-built executables or library files. If you don't know what is
`Cargo.toml` or `cargo`, please [read this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) before continue.

### Using stable version

To begin using the engine, just add following lines to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fyrox = "^0.27"
```

This will force Cargo to use the latest **stable** version of the engine.

### Using latest unstable version

Sometimes you want to use the latest features that are not yet released in a stable version, then you can use
the engine directly from its repository, simply add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fyrox = { git = "https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox" } 
```

This will update your build files fairly often. If you don't want game breaking changes to occur because of engine updates or want to not compile daily,
change `fyrox = { git = "https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox" }` to `fyrox = { git = "https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox", rev = "" }` with the commit
hash in the quotes.

## Editor installation

The engine offers an editor, to install a standalone version it, use `cargo install`:

```shell
cargo install fyroxed
```

Standalone version does not allow you to run your game inside it, but only allows you to edit scenes.

After that you can run the editor with a single command:

```shell
fyroxed
```

Check the next chapter to create a simple application.
