# Animation Editor

![anim editor](./anim_editor.png)

Animation Editor is a tool that helps you to create and preview animations. This is a powerful tool that can be used
to animated pretty much any numeric property.

It has three main parts:

1. `Toolbar` - contains a set of tools that changes a particular part of an animation (name, length, speed, etc.)
2. `Track List` - contains a list of tracks of nodes that will be animated.
3. `Curve Editor` - curve editor allows you to edit behaviour of a numeric parameter over the time. 

## Limitations

For now there's no dopesheet mode in the editor, you can edit only one numeric parameter at a time. Also, there's no 
capture mode - this is a special mode in which the editor automatically adds your changes in the scene to the animation.
These limitations will be removed in the future versions.
