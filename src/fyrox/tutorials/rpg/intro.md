# Role-Playing Game Tutorial

This tutorial starts the series of tutorials about writing a role-playing game in Rust using Fyrox game engine. Strangely,
but Fyrox has a reputation of an engine for 3D shooters. In this series I'll try to prove that it is a general purpose
game engine.

## Fyrox and Fyroxed version

Fyrox changes rapidly and tutorial's code could not compile with the newest versions of the engine, to prevent that
and keep the code compilable over time the versions of both the engine and the editor are set to specific commits 
in the main repo.

**Fyrox version**: 0.26
**Source code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox-tutorials/)
