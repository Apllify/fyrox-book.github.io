# First-Person Shooter Tutorial

**WARNING: This tutorial is using obsolete engine features, which are subject to be removed in future versions!**

In this tutorial we'll make a 3D shooter - something similar to [rusty-shooter](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-shooter).
Also, the series should help you to learn basic principles which lies in the foundation of the engine.

## Fyrox and Fyroxed version

Fyrox changes rapidly and tutorial's code could not compile with the newest versions of the engine, to prevent that
and keep the code compilable over time the versions of both the engine and the editor are set to specific commits 
in the main repo.

**Fyrox version**: 0.28  
**Source code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox-tutorials/)
